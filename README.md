# Snakes and Lasers 2.0.0
A lightweight 2d arcade style game based on the classic Snake game, but with a non-osha compliant twist.

---

### How to play:   
 - WASD to move the snake   
 - R to return to main menu   
 - Speedrun mode activates a timer and automatically ends the game once you reach 200 points.   
 - Lightweight mode removes all laser particles to reduce lag on very low end systems (like the laptop I used to make this game).   
 - Survival mode removes the objective and decreases the time between lasers.   
 - All three of these modes work at the same time, though Survival mode kinda defeats the purpose of Speedrun mode since the only possible time is 3:20.000. Also, it's nearly impossible to survive for that long.
